# Blurify
Blur an Image using some good old algebra, convolutions and a lot of maths. 

1. Download the main.ipynb files. That's all you will need to run this project. Keep an input image anywhere on your system to replicate the experiment.

3. Select the image of your choice anywhere from your desktop. I have provided a sampleinput.png for your convenience.

4. A popup with come up, requesting you to enter the Intensity of Blurring.

Just as it sounds, you need to input a number above 0 to blur the image. The higher the number, the stronger the blur.

The code will the show the following output. Graphs are neatly labelled and informative. They will show the input image
and the output image with the intensity that you selected.

5. The output will be saved as sampleoutput.png on your working directory. That's all!

Thank you! Any Feedback would be appreciated!
